## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in our clean data

```{r}
#| label: import

audits <- read_rds("data-processed/all-audits.rds")

audits
```

## Analysis
First, I want to group by each district to see which districts have had the highest financial aid adjustments. 

```{r}
audits |> group_by(district) |> 
  summarize(total_adjustments = sum(final_financial_adj, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(total_adjustments)
```

There seem to be a lot of special types of districts showing up. Let's only look at ISD's. 

```{r}
isds <- audits[grepl("ISD", audits$district), ]

isds
```

Now I will do the same but only looking at independent school districts.

```{r}
isds |> group_by(district) |> 
  summarize(total_adjustments = sum(final_financial_adj, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(total_adjustments)
```

Now let's look at which ISD has had the highest financial adjustments each year.

```{r}
isds |> group_by(district, yr = year(final_report_mailed)) |> 
  summarize(total_adjustments = sum(final_financial_adj, na.rm = TRUE)) |> arrange(yr |> desc(), total_adjustments)
```
